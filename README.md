# Windows-Form
This is my first project with Windows Forms in Visual Studio Community 2019. It's a simple form where user data can be entered and options can be selected. It simulates the creation of a profile with basic concepts, implementing tools such as scroll bars, buttons, labels, combo boxes, images, etc.
